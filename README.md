# üîê Keylogger Management System

A full-stack system for remote data collection and management from keyboard clients. Developed as a course project.

## üèó System Architecture

1.  **Client (C):** A low-level program that captures keystrokes and saves them to a local file.
2.  **Client (Node.js):** A transport agent that periodically or on-demand (long-polling) sends collected data to the server.
3.  **Server (Node.js + Express):** Receives data from multiple clients, stores it in a file, and provides a REST API for the frontend.
4.  **Dashboard (React):** A web interface to view collected data and manage clients (activate/deactivate, request data).
